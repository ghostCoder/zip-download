To run the test -
1) do "npm install"
2) run "webpack" or "node ./node_modules/webpack/bin/webpack.js"
3) open index.html in browser and click to test.

You can change the asset list in "src/assets.js"

Note - You may have to enable this or a similar chrome plugin to allow files to be downloaded from cross origin if you just want to open index.html in browser and test.
